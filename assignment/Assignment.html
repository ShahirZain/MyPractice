                With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.
                HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.
                Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML,
                 the language can be applied to any XML document,
                 including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, 
                CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications
                , and user interfaces for many mobile applications

            Computer programming
             is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. 
             Source code is written in one or more programming languages.
             The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task 
             or solving a given problem.
